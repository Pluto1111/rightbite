🌟 Project Context & Goal
This was a non-commercial pet project created with the help of the teamchallenge.io platform. The main goal was to create a full-scale product with a team of developers, including those newer to the industry, in order to learn and simulate the real-life process of software development and deployment.

✨ Key Advantage: AI-Driven Personalization
The core strength of this platform is the integration of an Artificial Intelligence component that transforms the shopping experience (BMI tab).

BMI-Based Recommendation: Users can input data to calculate their BMI.

Intelligent Product Curation: The system uses the calculated BMI result (and related metrics) to automatically filter and recommend a tailored selection of products, ensuring the suggestions are relevant to the user's specific health goals.
